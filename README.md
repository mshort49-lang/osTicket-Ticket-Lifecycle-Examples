Viewed the new ticket as John. Had to log back into the admin panel to add access to John. To be able to edit and assign the ticket to Jane, who is a part of the online banking department. After gaining access as John, I changed the SLA to Sev-A and the help topic to business critical.

Worked the ticket as Jane. The problem was a recent update, performed test, and a rollback of the update fixed the problem. I informed the vendor of the issue. Closed ticket.
